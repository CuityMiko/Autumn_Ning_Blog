# PostCSS

> “PostCSS is a tool for transforming CSS with JS plugins. These plugins can support variables and mixins, transpile future CSS syntax, inline images, and more.

## In this intro we covered what PostCSS is NOT:

* It’s not a pre-processor, though it can optionally behave like one.
* It’s not a post-processor, though it can optionally behave like one.
* It’s not about “future syntax”, though it can facilitate support for future syntax
* It’s not a clean up / optimization tool, though it can provide such functionality.
* It’s not any one thing; it’s a means to potentially unlimited functionality configured as you choose.

##  We also covered what makes PostCSS special:

* The diverse functionality available via its plugin ecosystem
* Its modular, “use what you need” nature
* Its rapid compilation time
* The accessibility of creating your own plugins
* The option to use it with regular CSS
* The ability to create libraries that don’t depend on one preprocessor
* Its seamless deployment with many popular build tools
